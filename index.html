        <li>
          In May 19, 2013, Jimmy was born in Barras-PI, first baby of my grandma's dog.</li>
        <li>
          At this time, I was 7 years old, and just due to his black and white colors I believed he was a Dalmatian. Actually, he is a mixed-breed.</li>
        <li>
          His name was chosen in a raffle, I wanted to call him Tobi. We made it in Teresina-PI, with my parents, sister, cousin and aunt.
          Resulted in Jimmy because my sister put on a bunch of american names in the raffle.</li>
        <li>
          My dad's friend built a little cement house in the backyard for him, with "Jimmy" engraved on the little stair.</li>
        <li>
          At first, he would mess up and tear everything in sight, which was normal for a baby dog. My dad used to punish him the wrong way.</li>
        <li>
          Due to the wrong education he received, he became an intolerant and unreliable dog, 
          making us to always have him locked during visits in our house.</li>
        <li>
          In October 2015, my dad finally said that he didn't wanted Jimmy anymore and made us donate him, after he ripped his shoes.</li>
        <li>
          The same day of the donate, we were warned that he ran away, so we spent 2 days 
          looking for him in a enormous grove/farm area and I stopped talking to my dad. We found him the 2nd day and he never left my side again.</li>
        <li>
          In 2019, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, which made her stay in Fortaleza-CE the whole year receiving treatment. At her toughest times, my dad
          would have to spent some months there to take care of her. So, I stayed alone in Ubajara with Jimmy, my best company. At this time I was 13,
          and I had never taken really good care of him, always relying on my parents. At this point I had to learn to be his actual "mom".</li>
        <li>
          We moved to Fortaleza in 2020, so the exams and treatment could be easier and I wouldn't have to be alone in Ubajara and my dad woulnd't have to
          travel so much. My mother was cured. Of course, Jimmy came with us, and I guess the different environment didn't do him so well. He started to itch and hurt himself
          a lot, creating wounds that would never heal. We tried everything we could to fix this, but we couldn't until today.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite that, everything went fine. As we was living in an apartment complex now, he refused to relieve nature up here.
          We started to go out with him everyday so he could, even though in Ubajara he was used to a lot more.
        </li>
        <li>
          August 2021, I made a foot surgery and stayed in bed for almost 1 month. He would always be there, by my side. It was at the same time that he went blind.
          I noticed his eyes were becoming whiter, so we took him to the vet. Turns out to be cataracts, common disease in poodle descendants. The surgery was too expensive
          and had chances of it being useless. In matter of two weeks he lost his vision completely, distinguishing light sources only. It was really sad, he tripped and bumped
          his head constantly. He began to have a lot of rheumatism in his eyes, it itched and hurt. But we got over it.

          Layla is my sister's dog. You can see her clicking <a target="_blank" id="tribute-link" href="file:///C:/Users/1/html/Tribute/pages/layla/Layla.html">here</a>.
          She would came to our home whenever my sister was in vacation. She and Jimmy didn't match. She would scare and opress him a lot, causing him
          to become isolated sometimes. However, she is an <strong>amazing</strong> dog and we really love her. My entire family prefers her, 
          but I stay still with my beautiful Jimmy.

          Today, as I'm writing this, is March 26, 2023. He is incredibly ok for a blind 9 years old dog. He eats well, he don't bite visits anymore, but barks out loud. His hair is very
          gray now, like his eyes. I go out with him twice in a day, my dad go once. I bath him every week and replace his food everyday. I'm 17 now. He turns 10 2 months from now.
          He is the love of my life. And always will be.
